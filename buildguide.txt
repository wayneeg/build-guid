#Building Guide to Bringup Rom

You need to have a linux distro with atleast 8 cores and atleast 12 gb ram and 130 gb of HDD.
#Setting up linux distro

For setting up linux distro we need to install some packages into our system for that , copy paste the preceeing code into your linux distro

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

/This will install the latest files of your linux distro/

Then to add those packages necessary for building , copy paste the preceding code

sudo apt-get install bc bison build-essential curl flex g++-multilib gcc-multilib git gnupg gperf imagemagick lib32ncurses5-dev lib32readline6-dev lib32z1-dev libesd0-dev liblz4-tool libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libxml2 libxml2-utils lzop pngcrush schedtool squashfs-tools xsltproc zip zlib1g-dev openjdk-8-jdk

#Now we need to install repo.

sudo apt-get install repo

#Now lets configure you github username and email globally.

git config --global user.name "AkhilMsAchu" 
git config --global user.email "akhilsree001@gmail.com"

#Lets make a directory where we will intialise our rom source mkdir lineage #It will make a directory named lineage

#Now Lets sync a Source into the lineage directory we have made cd lineage repo init -u "CLONE_URL" -b "BRANCH" #For example lets clone Lineage Source for Pie. #So the Branch will be lineage-16.0 for oreo it will be lineage-15.1. 
repo init -u git://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-16.0

#Now To sync the Source.

repo sync -j$(nproc --all)

#Wait for the sync to finish ,it takes time.

#Now we have to Clone Device tree, Vendor blobs and kernel Source, Search on github for your own device. #For example I am taking tulip ( Redmi note 6 pro)

#Lets clone device tree




git clone https://github.com/AkhilmsAchu/android_device_xiaomi_tulip.git -b lineage-16.0 device/xiaomi/tulip 


#Here the branch is mkp and location is device/xiaomi/tulip where the device tree will bs cloned

#Lets clone vendor blobs

git clone https://github.com/AkhilmsAchu/vendor_xiaomi_tulip.git -b pie vendor/xiaomi/tulip 

#Here the branch is mkp and clone path is vendor/xiaomi/tulip

#Lets clone Kernel Source

git clone https://github.com/AkhilmsAchu/kernel_xiaomi_tulip.git -b pie kernel/xiaomi/tulip

 #Here the branch is mkp and the clone path is kernel/xiaomi/tulip

#Now after cloning device tree , vendor blobs and kernel source we need to edit some Make files in Our devicetree in order to build the Rom #Make files which we need to edit are AndroidProducts.mk , lineage_tulip.mk(prefix differs from source to source) #we also need to edit vendorsetup.sh and the dependencies. #First lets go to the device tree directory where we have cloned it

cd device/xiaomi/tulip

#Now lets edit the AndroidProducts.mk

nano AndroidP* #you can see i didnt write the whole name of the file and also added a * at the suffix , well the main use of this is to reduce the writing, as it will automatically find the file you are targetting it also works to open directories

#Now we have to rename the

$(LOCAL_DIR)/mk_tulip.mk to $(LOCAL_DIR)/lineage_tulip.mk #save and exit i.e., ctrl + X then press y and then enter.

#Now we have to rename

mk_tulip.mk to lineage_tulip.mk #save and exit

#We need to edit the lineage_tulip.mk makefile

nano lineage_tulip.mk #Here we need to edit some specific lines $(call inherit-product, vendor/mk/config/common_full_phone.mk) to $(call inherit-product, vendor/lineage/config/common_full_phone.mk)

PRODUCT_NAME := mk_tulip to PRODUCT_NAME := lineage_tulip #save and exit

#Now go Back to the Rom directory cd ../../../ or cd ~ && cd lineage

And start the build

. build/envsetup.sh lunch lineage_tulip-userdebug brunch tulip
